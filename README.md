# The Book Of Answers

An easy python script to extract one answer from The Book of Answers.

The txt file comes from the project https://github.com/yujie-tao/the-book-of-answers 

I just write a simple python script to draw one answer from it.

If you have python installed, just type `./answer.py` to excute the file, after you set your path to the directory.
